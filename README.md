Spherical Voronoi Diagrams in Python

This repository contains a few Jupyter notebooks with examples how to work with planar and spherical Voronoi diagrams in Python. It illustrates [my talk at PyData London 2016](http://pydata.org/london2016/schedule/presentation/22/). The slides are available [here](http://www.nullteilerfrei.de/~airwalker/pydata2016/spherical_voronoi.pdf).
